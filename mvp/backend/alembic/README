# Alembic Migrations - SaaS-IA MVP

Generic single-database configuration with async support.

## Quick Start

### Generate a new migration

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"
```

### Apply migrations

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### Rollback last migration

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

### Show current revision

```bash
alembic current
```

### Show migration history

```bash
alembic history --verbose
```

## Important Notes

- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying
- Test migrations on a development database first
- Keep migrations small and focused
- Never edit applied migrations
- Always provide descriptive messages

## Async Support

This configuration uses asyncpg for PostgreSQL async operations.
All migrations run asynchronously for better performance.
